## Roasters Cafe Book Club 
### Site Overview

Roasters Cafe Book Club is a community focused book club which aims to bring together booklovers both new and old. They meet multiple times a week at their cafe where they read a nominated book and get together to discuss it. The aim of this website is to be a hub for the group where they can look at upcoming events, review books and also get book recomendations.
